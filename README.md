This is a Linear Regression Model from scratch. This model predicts the temperature values in F for Austin,TX based on average dew points for a given day using Least Squares Regression method.The goal of this project was to perform east squares linear regression using matrices. No complicated libraries are used for this model besides numpy & pandas(for data manipulation.) The dataset is obtained from (https://www.kaggle.com/grubenm/austin-weather). The answer in F is dependant on the given dewpoints. To predict what the temperature would be for a given dewpoint, modify the "dew_point" value to your liking.
