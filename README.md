## Description
This is a Linear Regression Model from scratch. This model _predicts_ the temperature values in F for Austin,TX based on average dew points for a given day using _Least Squares Regression_ method. The **goal** of this project was to perform least squares linear regression using **matrices**. No complicated libraries are used for this model besides ***numpy*** & ***pandas***(for data manipulation.) 

## Data Source
The dataset is obtained from (https://www.kaggle.com/grubenm/austin-weather). 

## Modifications to the model
The answer in F is dependant on the given **dewpoints**. ( Dew point temperature is defined as the temperature to which the air would have to cool. )

To ***predict*** what the temperature would be for a given dewpoint, modify the _"dew_point"_ value to your liking.
